# Uniprocess-Scheduling Algorithm 

simulation of Uniprocessor scheduling algorithm.
Each respective `c` source code is the following task scheduling algorithm.
* first come first serve
* Round-Robin
* Shortest Process Next
* Shortest Remaining Time
* Highest response Ratio Next

*the following image is taken from Operating Systems Book by William stallings*
This simulation take input of the information showed on the following table.
![Process Table ](/images/Process.png)

Then Each algorithm do the processing visualized by the following 
![Visualization](/images/Visualization.png)

then the result summary is showed by the following
