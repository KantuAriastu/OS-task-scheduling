# Uniprocess-Scheduling Algorithm 

simulation of Uniprocessor scheduling algorithm.
Each respective `c` source code is the following task scheduling algorithm.
* first come first serve
* Round-Robin
* Shortest Process Next
* Shortest Remaining Time
* Highest response Ratio Next

This simulation take input of the information showed on the following table.
